# Thread-Library
Non-preemptive user‐level library with semaphore support, that uses a FIFO (first‐in, first‐out) scheduling policy for threads in the ready queue.

## Thread routines

MyThread MyThreadCreate (void(*start_funct)(void *), void *args)  

This routine creates a new MyThread. The parameter start_func is the function
in which the new thread starts executing. The parameter args is passed to the
start function. This routine does not pre‐empt the invoking thread. In others
words the parent (invoking) thread will continue to run; the child thread will sit
in the ready queue.

void MyThreadYield(void)

Suspends execution of invoking thread and yield to another thread. The invoking
thread remains ready to execute—it is not blocked. Thus, if there is no other
ready thread, the invoking thread will continue to execute.

int MyThreadJoin(MyThread thread)

Joins the invoking function with the specified child thread. If the child has
already terminated, do not block. Note: A child may have terminated without
the parent having joined with it. Returns 0 on success (after any necessary
blocking). It returns ‐1 on failure. Failure occurs if specified thread is not an
immediate child of invoking thread.

void MyThreadJoinAll(void)

Waits until all children have terminated. Returns immediately if there are no
active children.

void MyThreadExit(void)

Terminates the invoking thread. Note: all MyThreads are required to invoke this
function. Do not allow functions to “fall out” of the start function.

## Semaphore routines

MySemaphore MySemaphoreInit(int initialValue)
Create a semaphore. Set the initial value to initialValue, which must be nonnegative.
A positive initial value has the same effect as invoking
MySemaphoreSignal the same number of times. On error it returns NULL.

void MySemaphoreSignal(MySemaphore sem)
Signal semaphore sem. The invoking thread is not pre‐empted.

void MySemaphoreWait(MySemaphore sem)
Wait on semaphore sem.

int MySemaphoreDestroy(MySemaphore sem)
Destroy semaphore sem. Do not destroy semaphore if any threads are blocked
on the queue. Return 0 on success, ‐1 on failure.

## Unix process routines

The Unix process in which the user‐level threads run is not a MyThread. Therefore, it will not be
placed on the queue of MyThreads. Instead it will create the first MyThread and relinquish the
processor to the MyThread engine.

The following routine may be executed only by the Unix process.  
void MyThreadInit (void(*start_funct)(void *), void *args)

This routine is called before any other MyThread call. It is invoked only by the
Unix process. It is similar to invoking MyThreadCreate immediately followed by
MyThreadJoinAll. The MyThread created is the oldest ancestor of all MyThreads
—it is the “main” MyThread. This routine can only be invoked once. It returns
when there are no threads available to run (i.e., the thread ready queue is
empty.

## How to use the library in your program

* All the routines are available via a library. Running the Makefile will create a mythread.a file.
* All programs that use this library will include a header file (mythread.h) that defines all
the interfaces and data structures that are needed—but no more.
* This library is not thread‐safe and will only execute in a single‐threaded (OS)
process. We assume that an internal thread operation cannot be interrupted by another thread
operation. (E.g., MyThreadExit will not be interrupted by MyThreadYield.) That means
that the library does not have to acquire locks to protect the internal data of the thread
library. (A user may still have to acquire semaphores to protect user data.)
* The interface only allows one parameter (a void *) to be passed to a MyThread. This is
sufficient. One can build wrapper functions that pack and unpack an arbitrary parameter
list into an object pointed to by a void *. Example programs are provided to demonstrate that.
* 8KB of memory is allocated for each thread stack.

mythread.h has two restrictions:
(1) Each thread must end in MyThreadExit and 
(2) The initial "UNIX" process context is
not used as a thread context. 

mythreadextra.h overcomes these restrictions:
1. It works correctly when threads do not end with MyThreadExit.
2. It provides a routine 'int MyThreadInitExtra(void)' that initializes the threads package and
converts the UNIX process context into a MyThread context.
...
MyThreadInitExtra(...);  
// code here runs in thread context.  
// it is the root or "oldest ancestor" thread  
MyThreadCreate(...); // Creates a new thread  
MyThreadYield(...); // Yield to new thread just created  
...
